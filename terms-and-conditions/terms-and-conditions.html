            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p class="lead"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> <span id="effective-date">1st October 2025</span></p>

            <p>Welcome to my mobile applications ("Apps"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of my
                Apps and any related services. By downloading or using the Apps, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="use">1. Use of the App</h2>
            <p>You agree to use the Apps only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You must not use
                the Apps in a way that could damage, disable, or interfere with their functionality or with other users'
                access.</p>

            <h2 id="license">2. License</h2>
            <p>I grant you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the Apps for your
                personal, non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.</p>

            <h2 id="intellectual-property">3. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All content, design, code, and materials in the Apps are owned or licensed by me and are protected by
                applicable copyright and intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or distribute any part of
                the Apps without prior written permission.</p>

            <h2 id="accounts">4. Accounts and Security</h2>
            <p>If the Apps require you to create an account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are
                responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under
                your account.</p>

            <h2 id="payments">5. In-App Purchases and Payments</h2>
            <p>Some Apps may include paid features or subscriptions. All payments are processed securely through Apple
                or authorized third-party processors. I do not store any payment information.</p>

            <h2 id="third-party">6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>My Apps may use third-party services such as Firebase (Google LLC) for analytics, authentication, or push
                notifications. Your use of these features is also subject to their terms and policies.</p>

            <h2 id="termination">7. Termination</h2>
            <p>I reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Apps at any time if you violate these
                Terms or engage in fraudulent or harmful behavior.</p>

            <h2 id="disclaimer">8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The Apps are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. I make no warranties, express or implied,
                regarding their operation, reliability, or availability. Your use of the Apps is at your own risk.</p>

            <h2 id="liability">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, I shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or
                consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the Apps.</p>

            <h2 id="changes">10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>I may update these Terms from time to time. Updates will be posted with a new Effective Date. Continued
                use of the Apps means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

            <h2 id="contact">11. Contact</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, you may contact me at:</p>
